1 stateful component not including app.js 4pts      =>      app.js doesn't need to be stateful, so you can just return a stateful component like Main in the app.js render method.

1 stateless functional component          4pts      =>      you can pass props to a component and then just manipulate them without using state. 
                                                        ie have a comopnent that does the map of an array and render that component in the Main component.

1 GET endpoing in express.                4pts      =>      const express =require('express');      Require express and save as a variable
                                                        const app = express();                  Saves an instance of express's invocation as a variable
                                                        app.get('ENDPOINT-URL',CONTROLLER-NAME.METHOD-NAME-ON-CONTROLLER);  Makes use of the get method on the saved instance of express.

One endpoint that uses req.body           4pts      =>      Endpoints are the server-side or back-end. So this means that the endpoint must use data sent to it from the front end.



Two additional components                 4pts      =>      Could be stateless or stateful.

Use a single component more than once     2-4pts    =>      Have a component that renders in more than one place on screen.
